# IOTA
# "An Open, Feeless Data And Value Transfer Protocol"



![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*jfUBdiUrE3gRkc0W.jpg)

Founded in Berlin in 2016, by four co-founders 

>Sergey Ivancheglo,
>Serguei popov,
>David Sonstebo and
>Dominik Schiener

>Sonstebo and Schiener are co-chairmen on the board of directors within IOTA, while Popov is a board member and the foundation’s director of research, Ivancheglo has resigned from the Berlin-based project back in June 2019 but continues as an unofficial advisor.

# The Idea-
Originally a Hardware start-up with a focus on Internet of things, a small crowdfund project “Jill” distributed the initial IOTA supply of 2,779,530,282,227,761 IOTA in a token sale raising 1,337 BTC for development worth around $580,000 at the time, IOTA has a fixed supply due to no mining rewards and or inflation, and is now being managed by a non for profit team in Berlin.

a major problem facing blockchain technology such as (Bitcoin) is the speed and price of current transactions involved with sending “peer to peer” funds. Another issue being size, as more and more transactions take place on blockchain the longer the ledger becomes, therefor less computers are readily available to mine it, whereas [IOTA](https://www.iota.org/) utilises devices to participate in a low-energy network within IOT, including mobile phones, cars and even smart appliances as nodes and miners to validate two previous transactions by performing [PoW](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained).

IOTA is key to play a central role in the next industrial revolution, enabling economic relationships between machines and bridging the human and machine economies


# ~~BLOCKCHAIN.~~ Tangle.
IOTA is a cryptocurrency project that is aiming to claim the title of “backbone” of the [IOT](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/05/13/simple-explanation-internet-things-that-anyone-can-understand/) (internet of things).
 It is distributed ledger with many similarities to blockchain projects but the most important difference being, 
 it’s not a blockchain. 
Instead, it’s a form of technology known as the “Tangle” which does not include blocks or a linear chain concept, offering its own unique advantages over the traditional blockchain.
Tangle is a system of nodes that validate transactions using [DAG](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-directed-acyclic-graph-in-cryptocurrency-how-does-dag-work) a directed acyclic graph which in short is a directed graph with no directed cycles, it consists of vertices and edges, with each edge directed from one to another, so that following these directions will never create a closed loop.

# Enabling possibilities 
## [Social impact](https://www.iota.org/foundation/social-impact)
>IOTA technologies focus on sustainable development and generating real-world impact. It tackles many world challenges like climate change, human rights violations, and the problems of the global unbanked population.
Using Collaborative ecosystems, Peer to peer cooperation, Digital trust and open data, IOTA works across many different sectors including civil society and industries to bring together diverse expertise, Empower individuals to interact to solve challenges there passionate about and enable development by overcoming inefficiencies in current infrastructure by making big data easily accessible. 
![image](https://blog.iota.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/ClimateCHECK_IOTA-_Blogpost.png)
## [Mobility](https://www.iota.org/solutions/mobility-and-automotive)
>IOTA is working on accessible, affordable, and sustainable connected mobility, many cars have already turned to digital platforms, with IOTA mobility plans, cars can pay autonomously with a car wallet for parking, charging their batteries, tollroads, and other services. But cars will also be able to make revenue, by selling the data they save or the power stored in their batteries during periods of high energy demand.
![image](https://iota-news.com/wp-content/uploads/ota-over-the-air-update-iota.jpg)
## [Smart cities](https://www.iota.org/solutions/smart-city)
>IOTA smart city concept is an area that uses communication and informative tech into everyday systems, certain “sensors” will retrieve data to inform residents and authorities in addition smart cities efficiently reduce consumption waste.
It provides residents with real time reporting within the IOT network, allowing business and governance to react proactively.
For government it also provides high quality data, enabling transparent and sustainable decision making
Corporations also benefit from the smart city concept with IOTA they can offer a common platform for businesses to interact with local governments or councils, their employees, residents and other local businesses.
![image](https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/as-smart-city.jpg)

## [Global trade](https://www.iota.org/solutions/global-trade-and-supply-chains)
>IOTA simplifies collaboration and provides trust between traders, governments, logistics and  general consumers.
IOTA is working on global partnerships to build a unique public data pipeline connecting traders and border control agencies to share data.

## [Digital identity](https://www.iota.org/solutions/digital-identity)
>IOTA uses three main roles for digital identity, Holders, Issuers and Verifiers
Holders own digital identities. They have control over their personal data and choose how much and with whom they share their data with.
Issuers are trusted third parties or authorities that generate and issue credentials to holders, such as health records or identity documents.
Verifiers are any third parties that need to verify the authenticity of a holder's data. A verifier might, for example, need to validate that the holder is who they say they are.

# How IOTA stacks up against major Blockchain 
IOTA has a similar distribution to rival [Blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp) king “Bitcoin”, One single IOTA is the smallest unit of currency you can purchase. 
With approximately 2.7 quadrillion IOTA in current circulation. You can think of a singular IOTA as being the smallest available unit of Bitcoin (BTC), one Satoshi, Except all of the IOTA in circulation was created by the first transaction on the Tangle, eliminating the need for traditional mining and power consumption.
IOTA is designed non-inflationary meaning that its value cannot be changed by increasing the amount of tokens in order to reward miners or stakers for example.

# In a ~~nutshell~~ Tangle.
Tangle is tackling major global issues and currently implementing real-world solutions as we speak, while blockchain technology has received majority of the public and media attention, with currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple featuring in mainstream news outlets, less has been said for IOTA which is a standout in the ALT coin market.
One negative to the Decentralized side to IOTA’s current network is the “Coordinator” which is owned and controlled by the IOTA foundation, this is seen as a centralized body but IOTA co- founders have confirmed a future roadmap plan to delete the “coordinator” once the network is on its feet, implementing a “coordicide” which refers to the day the foundation will no longer need a centralised issuer.

IOTA currently needs to work on there social media platforms to help with a gain in community members on the network, with the main scalability relying on users to confirm two or more previous transactions as opposed to Miners and validators in a [PoS](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/proof-of-stake/#:~:text=Proof%20of%20stake%20is%20a,add%20them%20to%20the%20blockchain.) system community is crucial to the future growth of the network.
